# STA141A-Course-Project

In this project I used data from the WHO COVID-19 dashboard https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv in order to compare countries pandemic response.
If the code in the R script does not run there is a backup file "WHO-Covid-19-backup.csv"
  This data was transformed to be by Country in country_d, which includes a new factor death_rate 

Classification and Population data using the UN WESP 2022 Report and US Census Popualtion Clock can be found in "fin_country_class.csv"

These two data sets were merged and then split in half based on popualtion for both developing and devloped countries.
The new data set became countries_large. "countries_large.csv"
